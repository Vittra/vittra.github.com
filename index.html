      The next step in corporate education.</div>

      <div class = textBoxBread>
  An app that can make corperative education simple and available, that was the goal during this case. <br><br>I worked with the interface design, experience design and the communication with stakeholders, users and the programmers to achieve the best visualisation and deliver the best experience.    </div>

    Content managing system to create education for the accompanied app.</div>
    <div class = textBoxBread>
      This CMS is the heart and soul when it comes to create and spread information and education to partipants of the Moblrn app. <br><br>The base of this case was about updating the old UI and to re-work the flow chart to better fit the users need and make it easier to use.

       Re-design an outdated page.</div>
    <div class = textBoxBread>
      There was two purposes with this re-design, the first was to modernise it and the second was to align it with the previousy re-designed graphical guidelines I created. <br><br>During the projects with Moblrn I had alot of oppurtunities to explore and define not only one design, but three different designs that each had different needs and purposes.<br><br>This is the third of Moblrn products I designed during three months, the previous two you can see above.

    Create the next site for the world's largest computer festival.</div>
    <div class = textBoxBread>
      The background to this case was to creat a digital platform where the client could interact with their users, not just during the LAN-events but all year around. And at the same time introduce their new user login “Dreamhack ID”. But also to convert their 27 different event and brand pages into one.
